                      <p>After transferring from Kennesaw State University to UGA, I changed my major from business to Communication Studies and Philosophy. After many philosophy courses, I decided to drop the dual major and finish with a Bachelors of Arts (B.A.) in Communication Studies. Subsequently, I took the LSAT and scored high enough to attend Gerogia State's Law School. However, I decided a career in law was not the direction I wanted for my career. I then landed my first full-time role at a small marketing company in North GA. After a year there, I moved to an analytics-driven, digital marketing company called 360i.</p>

                      <p>From summer to winter of 2016, I completed two bootcamps at General Assembly to kick off my career in coding and software development:

                        <br />My time in these courses are what set the stage for a long-term career in my passion: building! I learned that I am not only passionate about coding but I could pick it up and understand it quite easily. This launchpad allowed me the ability to build tools at my current role to expedite my daily tasks. In addition, I landed my first client and started my small business, Bryan W Nonni, LLC.

During these 3 years, I also started my coding journey at General Assembly by taking two bootcamps: Front End Web Development and JavaScript Development. I began applying these skills to my work by building apps and analtyics integrations to make business processes more efficient. I fell in love with buiding software, and I started attending classes at Georgia State part time. In 2018, I landed an internship as a Software Engineer at a startup called CloudTags. At this time, I was in school part-time, transitioning into a Web Development role at 360i, learning Python and R with the Data Science team at 360i and interning at CloudTags. Needless to say, I had a full plate, but I made it work!</p>

                      <p>After completing the bootcamps, I realized that I should be coding for a living. My career aspirations completely changed, and I focused all my spare time and attention to writing code and building apps. I decided it would be valuable to get back into a formal university education environment. I took all core classes and major classes towards a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. In 2017 and 2018, I was part time taking 1-2 classes at a time in the evenings. During 2017-2018, I also started a collaborative group at 360i between media managers and the Data Science group with the goal of fostering better collaboration between the two business units. Media managers with a desire to become more technial attended after work session to learn the fundamentals of Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Python and R. Meanwhile, I landed an internship at CloudTags and began to hone my skills in a production environment. In January of 2019, I quit my full time role at 360i and dove head first into a full time course schedule at Gerogia State. In one year, I completed 51 credits in courses such as Data Structures, Algorithms, Software Engineering, Web Programming, AI, ML, Cyber Security among others. I graduated from Georgia State University with honors, Summa Cum Laude, with a 4.05 GPA to achieve a Bachelors of Science (B.S.) in Computer Science.</p>

                      <p>CloudTags was a small Atlanta startup building technology in the retail space with a goal of connecting online and in-store commerce. While interning here, I learn basics of software engineering such as working in an agile scrum team, writing tests, etc. Over the course of my internship, I shifted to debugging in-production applications for our customers. Technology and languages I used were JavaScript, jQuery, Postgres, and Ruby. It was here that I first experienced working on a MVC application that uses a reverse-proxy. In early 2019, the startup officially dissolved in perfect time to allow me to focus exclusively on my course work at Georgia State.</p>
